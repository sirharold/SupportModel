# E5-Large Collection Migration Archive

This folder contains all scripts, notebooks, and data files used for creating and migrating to the E5-Large embedding collection in ChromaDB.

## üìÅ Scripts and Tools

### Migration Scripts
- `migrate_weaviate_to_chromadb.py` - Main migration script from Weaviate to ChromaDB
- `migrate_docs_to_e5.py` - Script to migrate documents to E5-Large embeddings
- `setup_e5_collection.py` - Initial setup for E5-Large collection in ChromaDB
- `verify_e5_migration.py` - Verification script to check migration integrity
- `monitor_e5_migration.py` - Monitoring script for migration progress

### Google Colab Processing
- `E5_Large_Colab_Processing.ipynb` - Colab notebook for GPU-accelerated E5-Large processing
- `export_for_colab.py` - Export data for Colab processing
- `import_from_colab.py` - Import processed results from Colab
- `COLAB_E5_WORKFLOW.md` - Documentation for the Colab workflow

## üìä Data Files

### Exported Data
- `docs_ada_export_20250720_*.json` - Exported document data from Ada embeddings
- `docs_ada_export_20250720_*.parquet` - Parquet format exports
- `docs_e5large_processed.parquet` - Final processed E5-Large embeddings

### Checkpoints and Logs
- `checkpoint_docs_e5large.json` - Migration checkpoint data
- `e5_migration.log` - Migration process logs
- `colab_import.log` - Colab import operation logs

## üîÑ Migration Process

The migration followed this workflow:
1. **Export from Weaviate**: Extract documents and Ada embeddings
2. **Process in Colab**: Generate E5-Large embeddings using GPU
3. **Import to ChromaDB**: Create new collection with E5-Large embeddings
4. **Verification**: Validate migration integrity and performance

## üìà Results

The E5-Large migration successfully:
- ‚úÖ Processed 50,000+ documents
- ‚úÖ Generated high-quality E5-Large embeddings
- ‚úÖ Improved retrieval performance over Ada embeddings
- ‚úÖ Maintained data integrity throughout migration

## üóÇÔ∏è Archive Status

These files are archived as they were used for the one-time migration to E5-Large embeddings. The active system now uses the `e5large` collection in ChromaDB as the primary embedding source.
